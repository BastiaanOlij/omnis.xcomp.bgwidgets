# omnis.xcomp.bgwidgets
xcomp containing an assortment of background widgets

This is a companion xcomp to the widgets library into which I'll add some background components.
Omnis does not allow combining of foreground (active) and background components in a single library.
As background widgets do not have any interaction with the user and are purely for drawing stuff I
won't be using the xcomp framework library.

I'll be adding more info to this readme as things progress.

# compiling
To compile download the SDK from the Omnis website and simply clone this within their folder structure:
- Externals
  - headers
  - complib
  - omnis.xcomp.bgwidgets
  - ...
